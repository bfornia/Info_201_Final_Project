## Technical Description
### 1. How will we read in the file?

### 2. Data Wrangling

### 3. Libraries to be used
We've selected a fairly simple dataset to be analyzed (numerical data, formatted as .csv), so we overall won't require the use of too many advanced packages. Below is the list we expect to take advantage of for this project.
- dplyr, lintr for basic r data wrangling and code quality
- ggplot2 and plotly for graphing and interactivity
- shiny f or web hosting, putting the final report together

### 4. Anticipated Challenges
Over the course of this quarter, we have mastered data wrangling and getting the data we want out of a dataset. Because of this, we expect the aspects of this report that did not get as much focus, including Shiny pages (which we will cover soon, but may be difficult to integrate in an advanced manner on such a short timeframe) and the proper formatting of a report to be the most difficult areas of this report to complete.
