 # Info 201 Final Project: Where Does It Pay To Go To School?

## Project Description
### 1. Dataset
The dataset we have chosen gives salary information by college, region and academic major. Specifically, the dataset uses a "mid-career salary" as a milestone to compare these different features. The dataset we will be working on will answer the broad question: "Where does it pay to go to college?". We have broken this ambiguous question into three sub-questions that we will answer in our final project. Moreover, the dataset comes from 'The Wall Street Journal', a U.S. daily newspaper. Hence, all of the data is based in the United States.

### 2. Target Audience
The target audience is juniors and seniors in high school and their parents.  These are the people who will most benefit from the answers to our questions when they are making decisions about where to attend college. 

### 3. What the Audience Will Learn
- What degrees have the biggest payback during mid-career?
- What colleges have the biggest payback during mid-career?
- Which region of colleges have the biggest payback during mid-career?

## Technical Description
### 1. How will we read in the file?
Each of our datasets are static and are stored as .csv files to be loaded in
using R. That being said, our data will only be as up to date as the files we
are reading.

### 2. Data Wrangling
For our project, we will be reformatting our given data to answer our
questions and create relevant visualizations. This could include joining and
filtering datasets into a functional format for our purposes.

### 3. Libraries to be used
We've selected a fairly simple dataset to be analyzed (numerical data, formatted as .csv), so we overall won't require the use of too many advanced packages. Below is the list we expect to take advantage of for this project.
- dplyr, lintr for basic r data wrangling and code quality
- ggplot2 and plotly for graphing and interactivity
- shiny f or web hosting, putting the final report together

### 4. Anticipated Challenges
Over the course of this quarter, we have mastered data wrangling and getting the data we want out of a dataset. Because of this, we expect the aspects of this report that did not get as much focus, including Shiny pages (which we will cover soon, but may be difficult to integrate in an advanced manner on such a short timeframe) and the proper formatting of a report to be the most difficult areas of this report to complete.
